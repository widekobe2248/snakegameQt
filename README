PLAN (Kobe's Idea):

Create a Scene that inherits two scene objects Head and Body items

Each head will hold an array or list or the game will be a 2d array for each section

The head will store the current direction and the input keys will change how the head changes
direction. 

It will also store the score. The body items will only hold the direction it will 
travel which will dictate the movement

When the head moves it will transfer that direction down the body and move and update its 
direction

When a head moves and eats a berry it will replace the previous head position with a body
that holds its direction 

When contact with an end of game material such as other player or body object will cause 
everything to stop.


Based on the settings passed from the first menu like player count and game speed will
change the intizalization of the game


//TODO's
Develop method of generating berries (to not overlap other body parts)
Create everything
